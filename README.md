### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to show what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment. This was achieved by preprocessing the data for PCA, reducing the data dimensions using PCA, clustering the cryptocurrencies using K-means, and then visualizing the results using scatter_3d(), hvplot.table(), and hvplot.scatter().
